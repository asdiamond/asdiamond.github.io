# [](#header-1)Nice to Meet You!

My name is aleksandr diamond, and I am an android/iOS developer currenty working out of El Paso, TX. I am a student, road-triper, and I do enjoy cups of coffee.

During Summer of 2018 I was a [software engineering intern](cerdec) at the US Army Communications-Electronics Research, development and Engineering Center. 

I have also spent about a year as an [Undergraduate Teachers Assistant](ta) in Computer Architecture at the University of Texas at El Paso. 

During my study at UTEP I was also lucky enough to be invited to the Robust Autonomic Systems research group. As an [Undergraduate Research Assistant](ra), I helped design and implement experiments for research into cache management.
